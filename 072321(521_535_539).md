<span style='color:red'> 521. Longest Uncommon Subsequence I (Easy)</span>  
Given two strings __a__ and __b__, return *the length of the __longest uncommon subsequence__ between* __a__ *and* __b__. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return __-1__.

An __uncommon subsequence__ between two strings is a string that is a __subsequence of one but not the other__.

A __subsequence__ of a string __s__ is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from __s__.

- For example, __"abc"__ is a subsequence of __"aebdc"__ because you can delete the underlined characters in __"aebdc"__ to get __"abc"__. Other subsequences of __"aebdc"__ include __"aebdc"__, __"aeb"__, and __""__ (empty string).

<span style='color:red'> 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL (Medium) -- Recommend </span>  
> Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk. Design a class to encode a URL and decode a tiny URL.

There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

Implement the __Solution__ class:

- __Solution()__ Initializes the object of the system.
- __String encode(String longUrl)__ Returns a tiny URL for the given __longUrl__.
- __String decode(String shortUrl)__ Returns the original long URL for the given __shortUrl__. It is guaranteed that the given __shortUrl__ was encoded by the same object.

<span style='color:red'> 539. Minimum Time Difference (Medium) </span>  
Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in __"HH:MM"__ format, return *the minimum __minutes__ difference between any two time-points in the list*.
