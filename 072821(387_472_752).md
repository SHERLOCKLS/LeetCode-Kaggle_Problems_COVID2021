<span style='color:red'> 387. First Unique Character in a String (Easy)</span>  
Given a string __s__, *find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index*. If it does not exist, return __-1__.

<span style='color:red'>  472. Concatenated Words (Hard)</span>  
Given an array of strings __words__ (__without duplicates__), return *all the __concatenated words__ in the given list of* __words__.

A __concatenated word__ is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

<span style='color:red'> 752. Open the Lock (Medium) -- Recommend</span>  
You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: __'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'__. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn __'9'__ to be __'0'__, or __'0'__ to be __'9'__. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.

The lock initially starts at __'0000'__, a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.

You are given a list of __deadends__ dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.

Given a __target__ representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.
