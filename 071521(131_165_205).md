### Type: String. Question numbers: 131， 165， 205
<span style='color:red'> 131. Palindrome Partitioning (Medium)</span>  

Given a string __s__, partition __s__ such that every substring of the partition is a __palindrome__. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of __s__.

A __palindrome__ string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

<span style='color:red'> 165. Compare Version Numbers (Medium) -- Recommend</span>  
Given two version numbers, __version1__ and __version2__, compare them.

Version numbers consist of __one or more revisions__ joined by a dot __'.'__. Each revision consists of __digits__ and may contain leading __zeros__. Every revision contains __at least one character__. Revisions are __0-indexed from left to right__, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example __2.5.33__ and __0.1__ are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in __left-to-right order__. Revisions are compared using their __integer value ignoring any leading zeros__. This means that revisions 1 and __001__ are considered __equal__. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then __treat the revision as 0__. For example, version __1.0__ is less than version __1.1__ because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are __0__ and __1__ respectively, and __0 < 1__.

*Return the following*:

- If version1 < version2, return -1.  
- If version1 > version2, return 1.
- Otherwise, return 0.

<span style='color:red'> 205. Isomorphic Strings (Easy)</span>  
Given two strings __s__ and __t__, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings __s__ and __t__ are isomorphic if the characters in __s__ can be replaced to get __t__.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
