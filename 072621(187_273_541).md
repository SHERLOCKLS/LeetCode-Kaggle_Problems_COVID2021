### Type: String. Question numbers:
<span style='color:red'>  187. Repeated DNA Sequences (Medium) </span>  

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as __'A'__, __'C'__, __'G'__, and __'T'__.

For example, __"ACGAATTCCG"__ is a __DNA sequence__.
When studying __DNA__, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string __s__ that represents a __DNA sequence__, return all the __10-letter-long__ sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in __any order__.

<span style='color:red'>  273. Integer to English Words (Hard) -- Recommend </span>

Convert a non-negative integer __num__ to its English words representation.

<span style='color:red'>  541. Reverse String II (Easy)</span>  
Given a string __s__ and an integer __k__, reverse the first __k__ characters for every __2k__ characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than __k__ characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than __2k__ but greater than or equal to __k__ characters, then reverse the first __k__ characters and left the other as original.
