### Type: String. Question numbers: 299, 389, 424
<span style='color:red'> 299. Bulls and Cows (Medium) -- Recommend</span>  
You are playing the __Bulls and Cows__ game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
Given the secret number __secret__ and your friend's guess __guess__, return *the hint for your friend's guess*.

The hint should be formatted as __"xAyB"__, where __x__ is the number of bulls and __y__ is the number of cows. Note that both __secret__ and __guess__ may contain duplicate digits.


<span style='color:red'> 389. Find the Difference (Easy)</span>  
You are given two strings __s__ and __t__.

String __t__ is generated by random shuffling string __s__ and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to __t__.

<span style='color:red'> 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement (Medium)</span>  
You are given a string __s__ and an integer __k__. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most __k__ times.

Return *the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations*.
