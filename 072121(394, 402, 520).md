### Type: String. Question numbers: 394,
<span style='color:red'> 394. Decode String (Medium) -- Recommend </span>  
Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: __k[encoded_string]__, where the __encoded_string__ inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly __k__ times. Note that __k__ is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, __k__. For example, there won't be input like __3a__ or __2[4]__.

<span style='color:red'> 402. Remove K Digits (Medium) </span>  
Given string num representing a non-negative integer __num__, and an integer __k__, return *the smallest possible integer after removing* __k__ *digits from* __num__.



<span style='color:red'>  520. Detect Capital (Easy)</span>  
We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

- All letters in this word are capitals, like __"USA"__.
- All letters in this word are not capitals, like __"leetcode"__.
- Only the first letter in this word is capital, like __"Google"__.

Given a string __word__, return __true__ if the usage of capitals in it is right.
