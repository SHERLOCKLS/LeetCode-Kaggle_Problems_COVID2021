### Type: String. Question numbers: 76, 171, 208
<span style='color:red'> 76. Minimum Window Substring (Hard) -- Recommend</span>  

Given two strings __s__ and __t__ of lengths __m__ and __n__ respectively, return the *__minimum window substring__* of __s__ such that every character in __t__ (__including duplicates__) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string __""__.

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is __unique__.

A __substring__ is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

<span style='color:red'> 171. Excel Sheet Column Number (Easy)</span>  
Given a string __columnTitle__ that represents the column title as appear in an Excel sheet, return *its corresponding column number*.

<span style='color:red'> 205. Isomorphic Strings (Easy)</span>  
Given two strings __s__ and __t__, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings __s__ and __t__ are isomorphic if the characters in __s__ can be replaced to get __t__.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
