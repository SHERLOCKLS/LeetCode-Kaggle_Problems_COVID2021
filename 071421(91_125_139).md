### Type: String. Question numbers: 91, 125, 139
<span style='color:red'> 91. Decode Ways (Medium) -- Recommend</span>  

A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

    ‘A’ -> "1"
    ‘B’ -> "2"
    ...
    ‘Z’ -> "26"
To __decode__ an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, __"11106"__ can be mapped into:

  - "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
  - "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".

Given a string __s__ containing only digits, return *the __number__ of ways to __decode__ it*.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a __32-bit__ integer.

<span style='color:red'> 125. Valid Palindrome (Easy) </span>  
Given a string __s__, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

    "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome. (amanaplana c analpanama)
    "raceacar" is not a palindrome. (rac ea car)

<span style='color:red'> 139. Word Break (Medium)</span>  
Given a string __s__ and a dictionary of strings __wordDict__, return __true__ if __s__ can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

__Note__ that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
