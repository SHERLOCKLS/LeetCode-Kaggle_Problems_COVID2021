### Type: String. Question numbers: 336, 433, 482
<span style='color:red'>  336. Palindrome Pairs (Hard) -- Recommend </span>  
Given a list of __unique__ words, return all the pairs of the *__distinct__* indices __(i, j)__ in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words __words[i] + words[j]__ is a palindrome.

<span style='color:red'> 433. Minimum Genetic Mutation (Medium) </span>  
A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from __'A'__, __'C'__, __'G'__, and __'T'__.

Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string start to a gene string end where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.

- For example, __"AACCGGTT"__ --> __"AACCGGTA"__ is one mutation.
There is also a gene bank __bank__ that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in __bank__ to make it a valid gene string.

Given the two gene strings __start__ and __end__ and the gene bank __bank__, return *the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from* __start__ to __end__. If there is no such a mutation, return __-1__.

Note that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.

<span style='color:red'> 482. License Key Formatting (Easy)</span>  
You are given a license key represented as a string __s__ that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into __n + 1__ groups by __n__ dashes. You are also given an integer __k__.

We want to reformat the string __s__ such that each group contains exactly __k__ characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than __k__ but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return *the reformatted license key*.
