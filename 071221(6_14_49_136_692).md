## Type 1: String

### Question numbers: 6, 14, 49

<span style='color:red'> 6. ZigZag Conversion (Medium)</span>  
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

    P A H N  
    APLSIIG  
    Y I R

And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
**string convert(string s, int numRows);**

<span style='color:red'> 14. Longest Common Prefix (Easy)</span>  
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

<span style='color:red'> 49. Group Anagrams (Medium)</span>  
Given an array of strings __strs__, group __the anagrams__ together. You can return the answer in __any order__.

An __Anagram__ is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Type 2: Counting

### Question numbers: 136, 692
<span style='color:red'> 136. Single Number (Easy)</span>  
Given a __non-empty__ array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

<span style='color:red'> 692. Top K Frequent Words (Medium)</span>  
Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.

Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency, then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.
